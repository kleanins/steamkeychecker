## Method 2: Running from Source (.py)

This method is for **Windows, macOS, and Linux** users who want to run the Python script directly.

#### Setup & Usage:

1.  Ensure Python 3 and Google Chrome are installed.
2.  Download the source code (`steamkeychecker.py`) to your Desktop.
3.  Open your **Terminal**.
    
    *   **On macOS, first run this one-time command to install developer tools (if not already installed):**
        ```
        xcode-select --install
        ```
        *(Click "Install" when a window pops up and wait for it to finish.)*

4.  Install the required libraries in the Terminal:
    
    *   **On Windows:**
        ```
        pip install pandas selenium webdriver-manager
        ```
        *If that fails, try:* `py -m pip install pandas selenium webdriver-manager`

    *   **On macOS or Linux:**
        *Since modern macOS versions protect system files, installing libraries into a "virtual environment" is the recommended method. Follow the steps below:*

        **a. First, navigate to your Desktop folder in the Terminal:**
        ```sh
        cd ~/Desktop
        ```

        **b. Create the virtual environment and install the libraries:**
        ```sh
        # 1. Create a virtual environment folder named 'steam-venv'
        python3 -m venv steam-venv

        # 2. Activate the virtual environment (you'll see '(steam-venv)' at the start of your prompt)
        source steam-venv/bin/activate

        # 3. Install the required libraries into this environment
        pip install pandas selenium webdriver-manager
        ```
        *(Note: When you are done, you can exit the virtual environment by typing `deactivate`. To run the script again later, you only need to repeat the `cd ~/Desktop` and `source steam-venv/bin/activate` commands.)*


5.  Place your CSV file named "sent.csv" on your Desktop.
6.  The file MUST have a column named "CD Key".
7.  Navigate to your Desktop folder in your Terminal (if you are not already there):

    *   **On Windows (CMD):**
        *   *Standard:* `cd Desktop`
        *   *OneDrive:* `cd %OneDrive%\Desktop`

    *   **On Windows (PowerShell):**
        *   *Standard:* `cd Desktop`
        *   *OneDrive:* `cd "$Env:OneDrive\Desktop"`

    *   **On macOS or Linux:**
        ```
        cd ~/Desktop
        ```
8.  Once in the Desktop folder, run the script:

    *   **On Windows:**
        ```
        python steamkeychecker.py
        ```
        *If that fails, try:*
        ```
        py steamkeychecker.py
        ```

    *   **On macOS or Linux:**
        *(Make sure your virtual environment is active)*
        ```
        python3 steamkeychecker.py
        ```
9.  A Chrome window will open. Log in to your Steam Partner account.
10. Follow the prompts in the console to start the process.
